# Single-Page CV
The goal of the project is to create a single-page CV that meets the following requirements:
- Written with semantically correct HTML
- Includes Search Engine Optimization *(SEO)* meta tags
- Includes Open Graph *(OG)*
- Includes a Favicon icon

Initially the project seemed simple, but then I realized that I had no clue what the requirements even meant, so I started my research. Note, I used Grok and Imagine by xAI to generate content for filling the CV, but not to generate the HTML itself.

## Semantic HTML
"Semantically correct HTML" refers to using all of the tags that HTML has appropriately. This is as opposed to overusing non-descriptive HTML tags such as the \<div\> or the \<span\> tag. There are many benefits of writing HTML like that, such as:
- It makes the HTML more readable for yourself and others that might have to use it.
- It improves the indexing of your website by search engines.
- It improves the accessability of your website.

A complete list of HTML elements can be found at [W3Schools HTML Element Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp).

### Example
```html
<header>
    <section style="display: flex">
        <section style="width: 50%; display: inline-block;">
            <h1>John Doe</h1>

            <p><b>Frontend Developer</b></p>

            <!-- Information about the CV owner -->
            <address style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap;">
                <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/go3bt2SeURmTy4hR9">San Francisco, CA</a>
                <span aria-hidden="true"> | </span> <!-- Divider element. Hidden from screenreaders! -->
                <a href="mailto:john.doe@example.com">john.doe@example.com</a>
                <span aria-hidden="true"> | </span>
                <a href="tel:(555) 123-4567">(555) 123-4567</a>
                <span aria-hidden="true"> | </span>
                <a href="linkedin.com/in/johndoe-dev">linkedin.com/in/johndoe-dev</a>
                <span aria-hidden="true"> | </span>
                <a href="github.com/johndoe">github.com/johndoe</a>
                <span aria-hidden="true"> | </span>
                <a href="johndoe.dev">johndoe.dev (portfolio)</a> 
            </address>
        </section>

        <section style="width: 50%; display: inline-block; text-align: center;">
            <figure>
                <img style="height: 150px;" src="john-doe.jpeg" alt="Generic profile image generated by Grok.">
                <figcaption style="position: absolute; margin-right: 10%;">Generic profile image of a man in a suit generated with assistance from Imagine by xAI</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </section>
    </section>
</header>
```
In this code snippet of my website's header, there are multiple examples of semantic HTML, and I'll address them in order:
- `<header>` - Typically, the header tag represents indroductory content, and I took my liberty to apply it to the information about the CV writer.
- `<section>` - The section tag represents a grouping of related content.
- `<h1>` - The H1 tag indicates that the enclosed text is the main title. I applied this tag to the name of the CV writer.
- `<p>`- The p tag indicates that the enclosed text is a paragraph.
- `<address>` - The address tag indicates that the enclosed content holds contact information.
- `<a>` - The a tag is used to provide a link to another website or part of the same website.
- `<span aria-hidden="true">` - Here I use the non-descriptive span tag to add a separator for the links. Additionally, the aria-hidden="true" informs screen readers to ignore the separator and not read it out.
- `<figure>` - The figure tag represents self-contaiend content, typtically an image or icon. I used it to represent the image of the CV writer.
- `<figcaption>` - The figcaption tag describes the content in the figure tag. I used it to very concisely describe the image and indicate that the image is generated.

All of these tags are descriptive with a specific purpose. This makes the particular section of the document much more accessible to screen readers as well as much easier to read and modify.

## SEO Meta Tags
SEO meta tags are tags used by search engines to understand your website and rank it better in search results. Some tags are supported by all of the main search engines, while many are not. Here is a link for [meta tags and attributes that Google supports](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/special-tags).

### Example
```html
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Single Page CV</title>
<meta name="description" content="One-page fictional HTML CV made for the learning-frontend-projects repository on GitHub by Seraphelion.">
<meta name="robots" content="">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

## OG tags
OG tags are used to control how your website is displayed on social media platforms. This significantly increases the click-through rates *(CTR)* of your website, also indirectly increasing SEO. More information on OG tags can be found on the [The Open Graph protocol website](https://ogp.me/).

### Example
```html
<meta property="og:title" content="Single Page CV">
<meta property="og:type" content="website">
<meta property="og:url" content="01-single-page-cv">
<meta property="og:image" content="https://www.yourdomain.com/image.jpg">
<meta property="og:description" content="One-page fictional HTML CV made for the learning-frontend-projects repository on GitHub by Seraphelion.">
